# Bias Exploration in Diffusion-Based Image Generation

This project investigates how different text-to-image diffusion models respond to prompts that may reflect social, demographic, or cultural biases. We generate images using three distinct models and analyze the resulting content using CLIP-based similarity scoring, VQA models, and manually constructed bias proposals.

##  Analysis Overview

- Image-text similarity was scored using CLIP (ViT-B/32).
- VQA-style questions were asked based on structured class options per prompt.
- The dominant predicted class (based on CLIP score) was used to analyze distribution and potential bias.
- Plots were generated showing frequency distributions of class predictions per prompt.
